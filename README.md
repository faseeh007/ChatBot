# Covid19-Bot

# **Project overview**

Chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. Simple chatbots work based on pre-written keywords that they understand, each of these commands must be written by the developer separately using regular expressions or other form of string analysis, if the user has asked a question without using a single keyword the bot cannot understand it and as a rule responds with default messages. Smart chatbots rely on artificial intelligence when they communicate with the users instead of pre-prepared answers the bot responds with adequate suggestions on the topic. A COVID-19 bot helps the user to get answer related all the queries/FAQ Related to Covid-19like Help Desk,Live News,Govt Announcements,Images and Videos related to Covid-19 etc.

## Application Features
A Covid19 chat bot is going provide a person with information regarding the number of covid cases based on the area input provided and if he/she needs to be vaccinated a suitable appointment is shown depending on vaccine choice provided by the user. Additionally provides information regarding helpful resources like plasma and oxygen.
Chatbots during Covid where mostly area oriented and were mainly made in language widely used in that area, which is an another benefit provided by NLP as English is not the only language it supports.The outcome of this project is to provide a chatbot which would help with the harsh conditions provided by COVID19.
